# The-four-hair-colours
### A program that returns the solution ( a quantum circuit ) to the Institut Quantique's enigma called the four hair colours.

ðŸ§¶: This program solves a quantum enigma presented by l'Institut Quantique of the University of Sherbrooke. Here's the link to the video explaining the enigma : https://youtu.be/enXT5xTaPb8?si=GLiveF63EjftJMIQ

context : At a carnival, Alice, Bob, Charlie, and Dalia decide to enter a contest to win an inter galactic trip. The challenge? Each person must guess their own hair color. The team will have to work together to find the right strategy to determine the orange or indigo color of their hair. 

This enigma has notions of entanglement, superposition, quantum parallelism and parity and the quantum gates CNOT and Hadamard are needed to solve it. 

I used both matplotlib and qiskit for the visualization and qiskit for the manipulation of quantum circuits, registers, qubits and classic bits.
